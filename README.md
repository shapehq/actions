## 🚀 Getting Started

Several of these actions depend on the 1Password CLI being installed. Please use 1Password's [install-cli-action](https://github.com/1Password/install-cli-action) action to install the 1Password CLI or [load-secrets-action](https://github.com/1Password/load-secrets-action) to load secrets into the workflow's environment.

Inputs prefixed with `op-` expect a 1Password item reference, for example `op://My Vault/My Item/field`. The action will use `op read` to fetch the value or file from 1Password at runtime.

Click on any action name below to view detailed documentation, usage examples, and configuration options for that specific action.

## 🏷️ Versioning Model

This repository is versioned as a whole, meaning all actions share the same version.

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Version bumps are based on changes merged into `main`:

- **Major**: Breaking changes to one or more actions (e.g. removed/renamed inputs, changed outputs, changed behavior in an incompatible way).
- **Minor**: Backwards-compatible changes (e.g. new action, new functionality, new inputs, enhancements).
- **Patch**: Bug fixes and other backwards-compatible maintenance changes.
