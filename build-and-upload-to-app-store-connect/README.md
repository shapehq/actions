## [build-and-upload-to-app-store-connect](https://github.com/shapehq/actions/blob/main/build-and-upload-to-app-store-connect/action.yml)

Builds an Xcode project, archives the app, exports an IPA from the archive, and uploads it to App Store Connect.
As a side effect, the action will upload the dSYM files as an artifact to the job.

```yml
- name: Build and Upload to App Store Connect
  uses: shapehq/actions/build-and-upload-to-app-store-connect@main
  with:
    scheme: Example
    configuration: Debug
    op-app-store-connect-api-key-issuer-id-reference: op://GitHub Actions/Company App Store Connect API Key/Issuer ID
    op-app-store-connect-api-key-id-reference: op://GitHub Actions/Company App Store Connect API Key/Key ID
    op-app-store-connect-api-key-file-reference: op://GitHub Actions/Company App Store Connect API Key/AuthKey.p8
    op-development-certificate-reference: op://GitHub Actions/Company Development Certificate/Certificate.p12
    op-development-certificate-password-reference: op://GitHub Actions/Company Development Certificate/password
```

You may use the `marketing-version` and `build-number` inputs to automatically set a version number and build number prior to building the project.

```yml
- name: Build and Upload to App Store Connect
  uses: shapehq/actions/build-and-upload-to-app-store-connect@main
  with:
    scheme: Example
    configuration: Debug
    marketing-version: ${{ inputs.version_number }}
    build-number: ${{ github.run_number }}
    op-app-store-connect-api-key-issuer-id-reference: op://GitHub Actions/Company App Store Connect API Key/Issuer ID
    op-app-store-connect-api-key-id-reference: op://GitHub Actions/Company App Store Connect API Key/Key ID
    op-app-store-connect-api-key-file-reference: op://GitHub Actions/Company App Store Connect API Key/AuthKey.p8
    op-development-certificate-reference: op://GitHub Actions/Company Development Certificate/Certificate.p12
    op-development-certificate-password-reference: op://GitHub Actions/Company Development Certificate/password
```

The action supports the following inputs.
